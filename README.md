## CIS3301-CODE-20-ChatGPT

## Instructions

In this code assignment, you are asked to develop a Python program to use the ChatGPT API. You can do a Python Script for any purpose, but your program should provide an appropriate message (printouts) that guide users to use it. Lastly, your program should write out all ChatGPT conversations (questions and answers) in a CSV file. Make sure you submit the CSV files that shows the questions and answers you obtained during testing.

## Helpful tips

* I recommend you use Pandas to write out all questions and answers to a CSV file.
